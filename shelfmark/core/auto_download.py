"""Automatic release selection + download for pending requests.

Given a pending request (typically synced from a Hardcover wishlist), this module
searches release sources in a user-configured priority order, applies a strict
title/author/format match guard, picks the best candidate from the first source
that yields a match, and queues it via the normal request-fulfilment path.

Design goals:
- **Strict by default.** Bias toward leaving a request pending (manual review) over
  grabbing the wrong file. Title and author must both match; the format must be a
  real audiobook format (no ebook-only fallbacks when targeting audiobooks).
- **Source priority is primary.** Walk the configured source order top-down and take
  the first source that produces at least one strict match.
