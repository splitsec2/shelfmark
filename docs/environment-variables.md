## Bootstrap Configuration

These environment variables are used at startup before the settings system loads. They typically configure paths, server settings, and authentication startup behavior.

| Variable | Description | Type | Default |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `CONFIG_DIR` | Directory for storing configuration files and plugin settings. | string (path) | `/config` |
| `LOG_ROOT` | Root directory for log files. | string (path) | `/var/log/` |
| `TMP_DIR` | Staging directory for downloads before moving to destination. | string (path) | `/tmp/shelfmark` |
| `ENABLE_LOGGING` | Enable file logging under LOG_ROOT/shelfmark/ (including shelfmark.log and startup logs). | boolean | `true` |
| `FLASK_HOST` | Host address for the Flask web server. | string | `0.0.0.0` |
| `FLASK_PORT` | Port number for the Flask web server. | number | `8084` |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | Enable secure cookies (requires HTTPS). | boolean | `false` |
| `CWA_DB_PATH` | Path to the Calibre-Web database for authentication integration. | string (path) | `/auth/app.db` |
| `HIDE_LOCAL_AUTH` | Hide the username/password login form when OIDC is active. | boolean | `false` |
| `DISABLE_LOCAL_AUTH` | Disable username/password login and remove the local-admin prerequisite for OIDC. Implies HIDE_LOCAL_AUTH; with AUTH_METHOD=builtin, everyone is locked out until auth env vars are changed. | boolean | `false` |
| `SHELFMARK_API_KEY` | Optional static API key. When set, requests carrying it as 'Authorization: Bearer <key>' (or X-Api-Key) are authenticated as an admin; browser sessions keep working. Unset = off. | string | `unset` |
| `SHELFMARK_API_KEY_READONLY` | Optional read-only API key. Can only GET `/api/stats`; never an admin. Unset = off. | string | `unset` |
| `OIDC_AUTO_REDIRECT` | Automatically redirect to the OIDC provider instead of showing the login page. | boolean | `false` |
| `DOCKERMODE` | Indicates the application is running inside a Docker container. | boolean | `false` |

## Egress / VPN Routing

These startup-only variables are consumed by `entrypoint.sh` / `wireguard.sh` to select and configure the WireGuard transparent-egress kill-switch. `USING_WIREGUARD` and [`USING_TOR`](#using_tor) (documented under Network) are mutually exclusive; both require root startup.

| Variable | Description | Type | Default |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `USING_WIREGUARD` | Route all traffic through a WireGuard VPN tunnel with a fail-closed iptables kill-switch (non-tunnel egress is dropped). Requires root startup and NET_ADMIN (plus NET_RAW). Mutually exclusive with USING_TOR. | boolean | `false` |
| `WIREGUARD_CONFIG` | Path to the mounted wg-quick configuration file. | string (path) | `/config/wg0.conf` |
| `WIREGUARD_INTERFACE` | WireGuard interface name brought up by wg-quick. | string | `wg0` |
| `LAN_NETWORK` | Comma-separated CIDRs kept off the tunnel so the WebUI and internal download clients (Prowlarr, qBittorrent) stay reachable. | string (comma-separated) | `127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16` |
| `WIREGUARD_ENFORCE_DNS` | Pin the container's resolver so DNS cannot silently fall back to an off-tunnel path. The resolver used is WIREGUARD_DNS if set, else the tunnel config's DNS = line. This does NOT force queries through the tunnel: it is designed for a trusted LAN resolver kept reachable off-tunnel via LAN_NETWORK (the query leaves over the LAN; the resolver encrypts upstream while the download still egresses via the tunnel). Special case: when Docker's embedded resolver (nameserver 127.0.0.11) is present, it is PRESERVED so container-name resolution (e.g. prowlarr, qbittorrent) keeps working, and the embedded resolver's upstream must be pinned via the container's compose dns: list. Fails closed (refuses to start) only when no embedded resolver is present AND no resolver is defined, or /etc/resolv.conf is not writable. | boolean | `true` |
| `WIREGUARD_DNS` | Explicit resolver(s) (comma/space separated) to pin when WIREGUARD_ENFORCE_DNS is true and Docker's embedded resolver is NOT in use. Use when the VPN's pushed DNS filters domains you need; point it at a resolver reachable via the tunnel or an allowed LAN resolver. NOTE: when the embedded resolver (127.0.0.11) is present it is preserved and this value cannot repoint its upstream from inside the container — set the container's compose dns: list to the trusted resolver instead. | string (comma-separated) | `unset (uses config DNS = line)` |
| `WIREGUARD_DISABLE_IPV6` | Strip IPv6 Address/AllowedIPs/DNS from the tunnel config before wg-quick (many container kernels lack the ip6tables raw table wg-quick needs) and remove IPv6 as a leak surface. | boolean | `true` |
| `WIREGUARD_ALLOW_IPV6_LEAK` | Escape hatch: continue startup even when an IPv6 kill-switch cannot be installed AND IPv6 cannot be disabled. Only set when the container has no IPv6 connectivity, as IPv6 egress may otherwise bypass the tunnel. | boolean | `false` |
| `WIREGUARD_ALLOW_WEBUI_OFFTUNNEL` | When false (default) the kill-switch is strictly fail-closed: the only off-tunnel egress permitted is loopback, the tunnel device and the LAN allowlist. Set true only if a NON-LAN client (e.g. a public reverse proxy on a different segment) must reach the WebUI; it permits app-server REPLY packets (--sport FLASK_PORT, conntrack REPLY) to leave off-tunnel. Server replies only, never client-initiated egress, so it cannot leak outbound browsing/downloads or the real IP for outbound requests, but it is still an off-tunnel path while the tunnel is down, hence opt-in. LAN WebUI clients never need it (covered by LAN_NETWORK). | boolean | `false` |
| `WIREGUARD_STALE_AFTER` | Seconds since the last WireGuard handshake before the healthcheck bounces the tunnel. | number | `180` |

The mam_id value MyAnonamouse shows when you create a session. MAM locks each session to one IP or ASN, so reusing Prowlarr's or another client's session often fails with a 403: you will likely need a separate session for Shelfmark if it reaches MAM from another IP (different host, VPN or proxy) or the existing session is ASN-locked to another network. Leave empty to turn enrichment off.
